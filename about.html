    <h1>ABOUT DISCOVERY</h1>
    <p>Daft Punk's Discovery is a groundbreaking album that blends the duo's signature house music with a wide array of
        genres, including disco, funk, rock, and electronic pop. Released in 2001, the album marked a significant
        evolution in Daft Punk's sound, introducing a more melodic and accessible approach compared to their earlier
        work. Discovery is celebrated for its innovative use of samples, vocoder-heavy vocals, and its nostalgic nods to
        1970s and 1980s music.

        Tracks like "One More Time," "Digital Love," and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" quickly became iconic,
        showcasing the duo's ability to craft infectious, danceable tunes that resonate with a broad audience. The album
        also served as the soundtrack to the anime film Interstella 5555, further emphasizing Daft Punk's unique vision
        and creative artistry.

        Discovery remains a landmark album in electronic music, cementing Daft Punk's reputation as pioneers of the
        genre and pushing the boundaries of what electronic music can achieve.

    <p>
        Daft Punk were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de
        Homem-Christo. They achieved early popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement, combining
        elements of house music with funk, disco, techno, rock and synth-pop. They are regarded as one of the most
        influential acts in dance music.

        Daft Punk formed after Bangalter and de Homem-Christo's indie rock band, Darlin', disbanded. Their debut album,
        Homework, was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by the singles "Around the World"
        and "Da Funk". From 1999, Daft Punk assumed robot personas for public appearances, with helmets, outfits and
        gloves to disguise their identities.
