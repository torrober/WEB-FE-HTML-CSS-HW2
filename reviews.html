        An early contender for the year's best dance/pop album.

    <blockquote>
        It feels like a concept album -- in this case, the story of how wine-flow disco circumnavigated intellectual
        pretensions on all sides en route to a temporary utopia that may finally believe in nothing but the boogie but
        still has the infinite on its mind every minute. [June 2001, p.145]

    <blockquote>
        Daft Punk have pulled off a brilliant wheeze by re-inventing the mid-'80s as the coolest pop era ever. And not
        even the officially approved retro-kitsch cool of Madonna's lukewarm excursions into post-Daft terrain but all
        the bubble-permed, sports-jacket-and-jeans excesses they can muster.... Mostly, though, 'Discovery' is simply
        fantastic pop...

    <blockquote>
        No moment of Discovery is left unfilled with an idea, a sonic joke, a spark of brilliance.... a towering,
        persuasive tour de force which ultimately transcends the dance label.
